As one goes 'deeper' into the cylinder the amount of distortion is less because we are closer to the axis of rotation. This will mean that the shear stresses are not uniform on any circular cross section of the cylinder."

I used this image because it make the relationship between $\\gamma$ and where you are within the cylinder more clear. On the axis of the cylinder there has been NO distortion $d\\phi$ and not surprisingly $\\gamma_{r=0}=0$ at that point. As we move out from the axis of the cylinder $\\gamma$ increases to some maximum value value $\\gamma_{max}$ at the surface of the cylinder. Perhaps you notice that $\\gamma_{max}$ at the surface is the same regardless of the distance from the far end. Assuming the angle is small we notice \n",
