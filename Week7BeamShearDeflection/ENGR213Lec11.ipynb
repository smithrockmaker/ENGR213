    "\n",
    "Stress, whether shear or normal, has units of Force/area. This is a useful way of thinking about the strength of the material resisting that stress because it clear responds to the effect of increasing surface area. A common engineering situation that is different is the case of beam sections which are attached to each other with fastners like nails or rivets. In such a circumstance the internal forces are resisted by point loads in some sense. Shear flow is a conceptual tool that applies in this context. Here is an example...\n",
