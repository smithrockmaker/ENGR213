This diagram documents the behavior of a given material across a wide range of stresses up to the point of failure. From this diagram we can anticipate the behavior of a material under particular use cases."

    "A standard place to start the discussion of the stress-strain curve or diagram is with normal stresses particularly tension. It is no surprise that when we apply a normal stress to a material it stretches which we call strain. We can apply increasing tensile force to a sample while measuring the strain until the sample fails or breaks. Similar data sets exist for compression and torsion (shear) but we will begin our exploration thinking primarily about tensile data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human beings come in a remarkable variety of forms and yet there are a set of common features that we usually see across all those forms. Stress-strain diagrams are the same. We are going to learn a language for describing a range of features that can occur in a stress-strain diagram but remember that not all features will look the same on different diagrams.\n"

Implicit in the data presented in the plot is the idea that as we increase the stress (loading) the strain increases as indicated by the data. IF we stop increasing the stress and reduce it back to zero (incrementally) - called unloading then the strain returns along a 'path' that may **NOt** be the same as that indicated by the data.\n",

    "Two variables are proportional if they have a linear relationship. In many stress strain diagrams there is a region at the 'begining' of the diagram where the relationship between the stress and the strain is linear. This is the proportional or linear region of behavior. The maximum stress for which the stress and strain are proportional is called the proportional limit and is labeled $\\sigma_P$. If the stress on the material never exceeds $\\sigma_P$ then the material will return to it's original length when it is unloaded following along the linear region of the diagram.\n",

At the this point the material has been permamently deformed by the stress. As the material is unloaded it returns by a 'path' which is usually parallel to the proportional part of the diagram. This leaves the material being measured with a permanent strain called the offset strain. \n",

What this often looks like in the real world is that we put a large stress on the material and it 'sags' and stretches which increases the strain but also reduces the stress if it stretches enough. If we were to actually calculate the stress based on the actual cross section the stress-strain diagram usually continues upward towards the end.\n",

If the stress on the material due to external loading exceeds $\\sigma_u$ then the external loads will maintain that stress even as the material stretches until it fails. IF the stresses exceed $\\sigma_u$ for a short period of time one can imagine that the material stretches but does not fail. \n",
