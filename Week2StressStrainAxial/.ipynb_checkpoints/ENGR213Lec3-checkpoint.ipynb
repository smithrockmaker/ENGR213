    "In previous courses and discussions we have assumed that materials are ideal in the sense that they do not change due to forces and moments that are applied to them. This is the definition of ideal physics equipment. In this class we now address not just the failure of the material that might be produced by excessive forces but the distortions of those materials.\n",

Despite the fact that the strain is actually dimensionless is it typically described as cm/cm, m/m, in/in, or ft/ft.  The standard symbol used is $\\epsilon$.\n",

    "This same consideration comes up when we ask how much the length of a material has changed under the action of a stress (normal or shear). The two possibilities are the original length of the material before it was stretched or the deformed length after it was stretched. The former is called Eulerian (oil-er-ian) strain and the latter is call Lagrangian stain.\n",
