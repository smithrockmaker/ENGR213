    "We're used to thinking about the impact of external forces on engineering solutions but we sometimes overlook the effect of thermal expansion on the elements of a structure. Because thermal expansion is a process at the atomic level or molecular level it will happen whether we wish it or not. We sometimes can use this effect as an intentional design element and sometimes we need to anticipate the unintended consequences of thermal expansion. Given the precise tolerances for many technological tools will they work equivalently well in Antartica as well as the Middle East? \n",

Alternatively once can imagine the two strains happening sequentially. Usually we determine the strain due to temperature change and then consider what normal stress is needed to change the strain to meet the constraints of the problem.\n",
