Now we need to apply these tools various engineering settings. Not surprisingly we will start with a relatively simple setting where we are dealing with axial loads. Even though the loads are axial there are both shear and normal stresses to be considered depending on the particular surfaces we are interested in."

In this context if the member only varies along one axis and any loads on the member are directed along that same axis we have an axial member that is subject to axial loads.\n",
