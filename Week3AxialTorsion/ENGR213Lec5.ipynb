    "At this point we have the relationships between stress and strain worked out along with an understanding of the stress-strain curves for various materials. Now we need to apply these tools various engineering settings. Not surprisingly we will start with a relatively simple setting where we are dealing with axial loads. Even though the loads are axial there are both shear and normal stresses to be considered depending on the particular surfaces we are interested in."

    "There are many engineering settings where the individual members that make up the 'machine' are essentially axial members and are only loaded axially. In this context if the member only varies along one axis and any loads on the member are directed along that same axis we have an axial member that is subject to axial loads.\n",
